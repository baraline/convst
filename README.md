Welcome to the convst repository. It contains the implementation of the `Random Dilated Shapelet Transform (RDST)` along with other works in the same area.

## Installation

The package was built and is using Python 3.8+ as default. If inquieries are made for support of earlier version of Python, i will make the adjustements.

The recommended way to install the latest stable version is to use pip with `pip install convst`. To install the package from sources you can download the latest version on github and run `python setup.py install`. This should install the package and automaticaly look for the dependencies using `pip`. 

We recommend doing this in a new virtual environment using anaconda to avoid any conflict with an existing installation. If you wish to install dependencies individually, you can see dependencies in the `requierements.txt` file.

An optional dependency that can help speed up numba, which is used in our implementation, is the Intel vector math library (SVML). When using conda it can be installed by running `conda install -c numba icc_rt`. I didn't test the behavior with AMD processors but i suspect it won't work.

## Tutorial
We give here a minimal example to run the `RDST` algorithm on any dataset of the UCR archive using the sktime API to fect dataset:

```python

from convst.classifiers import R_DST_Ridge
from convst.utils.dataset_utils import load_sktime_dataset_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, _ = load_sktime_dataset_split(
    'GunPoint', normalize=True
)

# First run may be slow due to numba compilations on the first call. 
# Run small dataset like GunPoint if this is the first time you call RDST on your system.
# You can change n_shapelets to 1 to make this process faster.

rdst = R_DST_Ridge(n_shapelets=10_000).fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Accuracy Score for RDST : {}".format(rdst.score(X_test, y_test)))
```

## Suported inputs

We use the standard scikit-learn interface and expect as input a 3D matrix of shape `(n_samples, n_features, n_timestamps)`. Note that as only univariate is supported in version 0.15.0, RDST will only process the first feature.

A generalized version of the algorithm will be available in next release, allowing to classify multivariate and/or uneven length time series.

## Reproducing the paper results

Multiple scripts are available under the `PaperScripts` folder. It contains the exact same scripts used to generate our results.

To obtain the same resampling data as the UCR archive, you must use the [tsml](https://github.com/uea-machine-learning/tsml/blob/master/src/main/java/examples/DataHandling.java) java repository, then from the class `DataHandling` in the package examples, use the function `resamplingData` and change where to read and write the data from. The function assumes the input is in arff format, they can be obtained on the [time serie classification website](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/)

## TODO for relase 1.0:

- [ ] Finish Numpy docs in all python files
- [ ] Update documentation and examples
- [ ] Enhance interface for interpretability tools
- [ ] Add the Generalised version of RDST
- [ ] Continue unit tests and code coverage/quality
