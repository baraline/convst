Those script containt the methods used for generating the results of the paper. If you wish to use some of them, modify the base path and any path variable that is present in the start of each script.
You will also have to download some dataset files so the same split are used for experiments involving resampling.

TODO : Is sktime default train test split equivalent to arff files, can we reproduce the exact tsml splits using the sktime interface and the same random state ids ?
